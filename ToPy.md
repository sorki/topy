# Introduction #

What is ToPy? The short version: Topology optimization using Python.

The long version: Have a look at my thesis (under [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/topy/downloads/list))


# Details #

Currently, the only way to get ToPy is to download the zip file. I haven't had time to commit via Git yet, and I still have to learn how to use Git in any case... ToPy was/is small and simple enough that I never bothered to learn how to use a revision control & SCM.

# Examples #
See ToPyExamples for two examples of the input (problem definition) files and their output after it was solved with ToPy.
